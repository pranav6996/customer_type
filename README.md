# Telecom Customer Classification with KNN

Welcome to my *Telecom Customer Classification* project! Here, I used the classic **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict customer segments based on their data, analyzing accuracy scores to see how well the model performs.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Telecom customer data from IBM Skills Network  
- **Goal:** Classify customers into different segments using KNN  
- **Tasks:**  
  - Load and explore the dataset  
  - Apply KNN classification  
  - Evaluate the model’s accuracy with different parameters  

## 📊 What I Did

1. Loaded the dataset directly from the cloud using pandas  
2. Preprocessed the data (cleaning, encoding, etc.)  
3. Implemented the KNN algorithm using scikit-learn  
4. Tested various values of K to optimize accuracy  
5. Compared accuracy scores to identify the best performing model  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- KNN works well for classification problems when data is labeled  
- Model accuracy depends heavily on choosing the right number of neighbors (K)  
- Evaluation is essential to find the sweet spot between underfitting and overfitting
